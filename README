The CVS and SVN versions are now complete and sharing the same
code.  You can define which Version system you are using with a single config parameter.

To configure your install, all changes can be made in the docroot/lib/config.inc.php

Command-line tools to add / edit / and add files to projects are
in the bin folder as well as aliases files that you can source
from your .bashrc or .cshrc files (after some customization).

Since the remote_call isn't implemented yet, we are still limited
to all staging envs at least being able to gain access to the
/projects/ dir to be able to function.

TODO:
1) Finish porting the remote_call connection for remote access to the /projects/ dir and logs
2) Explain (and make easier) to people how to install the SUDO perms of the APACHE-running-CVS bits
3) Write more docs
