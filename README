For now, I've put both CVS and the SVN versions side-by-side in
the docroot folder.  The CVS version is frest from the rough port
from Perl, and I barely got it to compile (NOTE, I skipped over
the Remote Call stuff, which shouldn't be too hard to port)

TODO:
1) Finish porting the remote Perl-to-PHP port for CVS
2) Find the rest of the bugs in the CVS frmo the Perl Port
3) Finish the SVN version:
    a) tags aren't working at all
    b) updates aren't working
    c) permissions for running SVN over https AUTH still need working out
4) Abstract the version system to a config param (unify the 2 dirs)
5) Explain (and make easier) to people how to install the SUDO perms of the APACHE-running-CVS bits
